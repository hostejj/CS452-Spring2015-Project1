The rules to interact with the game are located on the web page and also below:

Objective: Do not let the aliens travel through this space sector (pass the yellow line).
Your ship is invincible but has limited offensive capabilities 
(Can only maintain four bullets on the screen in each direction). 
If too many aliens pass through the sector the game will end. 

Controls: Use the WASD keys to move the ship and the L to fire. 
Pressing T will toggle between forward shooting bullets and sideward shooting bullets.
Press the start game button when ready. Press reset followed by start game to restart a game after a game over.

Scoring: One point is earned for each shot that hits an enemy ship. There is no winning,
but the object is to get the highest possible score. Each green enemy that passes the line deducts 
one life from the lives count, each purple enemy that passes deducts two lives. The game ends after lives
are reduced to less than zero.
